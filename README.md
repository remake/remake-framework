This is the latest version of the Remake framework, along with a Trello clone app.

# Easiest way to get started

Instead of using this repository, use the official Remake CLI to generate this starter project.

https://github.com/panphora/remake

However, if you want to set it up manually, feel free to follow the following instructions:

# Set Remake up manually (not through the Remake CLI):

1. Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/panphora/remake-framework.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```
cd remake-framework
npm install
```

3. Create a `variables.env` file

inside `variables.env`:
```
SESSION_SECRET=__replace_with_something_secret__
PORT=3000
```

4. Start the project

```
npm run dev
```
