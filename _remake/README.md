_YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO EDIT FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY_

The Remake framework code is in this directory.

Feel free to explore:

- The client-side Remake framework lives in `/_remake/client-side` and is compiled into `/_remake/dist`
- You can find the backend code in `/lib` and `/utils`. To see the backend code, start at `/_remake/main.js` and go from there! 🚴‍♀️
